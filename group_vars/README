# group_vars directory

The “group_vars/” files are files that live in a directory alongside an inventory file, with an optional filename named after each group. This is a convenient place to put variables that will be provided to a given group, especially complex data structures, so that these variables do not have to be embedded in the inventory file or playbook.
